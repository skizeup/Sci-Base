    "title": "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition",
    "authors": ["Karen Simonyan", "Andrew Zisserman"],
    "year": 2014,
    "abstract": "In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers.",

    "authors": ["Joseph Redmon", "Santosh Divvala", "Ross Girshick", "Ali Farhadi"],
    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation.",

    "abstract": "We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition.",

    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousands of annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.",
