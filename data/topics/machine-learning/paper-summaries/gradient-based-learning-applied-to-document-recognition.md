### Context
This research tackles the challenge of effectively training neural networks for document recognition by addressing a common issue in machine learning: preprocessing large datasets like images without extensive effort.

---

### Approaches
The study employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a multi-layer architecture. This approach is effective for image recognition as it leverages local patterns, which are crucial for distinguishing between similar digits or characters in an unprocessed dataset.

---

### Results
- **Performance**: Achieved 98% accuracy on MNIST, a standard dataset of handwritten digit images.
- **Efficiency**: The model demonstrated good performance without extensive preprocessing, highlighting the robustness of neural networks to initial data quality.
