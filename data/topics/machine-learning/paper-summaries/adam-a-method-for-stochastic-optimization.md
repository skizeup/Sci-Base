### Context
Why is this research important? In machine learning, optimizing parameters in neural networks often involves finding the best set of weights to minimize a loss function. This paper introduces Adam, an optimization algorithm that addresses these challenges by efficiently handling stochastic objective functions.

### Approach
Quoting from the abstract, Adam proposes using adaptive estimates of lower-order moments instead of gradient values directly. This approach simplifies the method while improving efficiency and adaptability.

### Results
The key results include the algorithm's computational efficiency, low memory requirements, invariance to certain rescalings of gradients, and suitability for large datasets and complex models.

### Impact
This paper is significant as it provides a practical choice for training deep learning models. It simplifies hyperparameter tuning by requiring fewer parameters compared to traditional methods. Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and various areas where neural networks are employed.
