    "title": "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding",
    "authors": ["Jacob Devlin", "Ming-Wei Chang", "Kenton Lee", "Kristina Toutanova"],
    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "We demonstrate that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. We train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, and test its performance in the few-shot setting.",

    "authors": ["Tomas Mikolov", "Kai Chen", "Greg Corrado", "Jeffrey Dean"],
    "year": 2013,
    "abstract": "We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. We present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector.",

    "year": 2014,
    "abstract": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. We conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word.",
